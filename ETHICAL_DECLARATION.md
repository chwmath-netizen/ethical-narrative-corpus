# Ethical Declaration

This document defines the ethical intent, boundaries, and expectations
surrounding the use of the **Ethical Narrative Corpus**.

It does not replace the LICENSE, nor does it impose legal restrictions.
Its purpose is to clarify **what this project is for, and what it refuses to be used for**.

---

## 1. Why This Corpus Exists

The Ethical Narrative Corpus exists to explore **human understanding**, not to prescribe moral rules.

This project is based on the belief that ethical judgment cannot be reliably
instilled through explicit instructions alone.
Humans do not make decisions solely through rules, but through:

- accumulated relationships
- memory and responsibility
- delayed consequences
- social and historical context
- lived experience over time

Narrative is used here not as entertainment, but as a medium capable of
preserving these elements without reducing them to labels or scores.

The goal of this corpus is not to teach an AI *what is right*,
but to expose it to **how humans actually live, choose, and endure**.

## 2. Why No Prescriptive Ethics Are Provided

This corpus intentionally avoids defining correct or incorrect behavior.

It does not contain:
- moral checklists
- reward-based ethical labels
- predefined behavioral outcomes

Prescriptive ethics often produce systems that appear aligned,
but collapse when context changes.

By contrast, this project aims to leave sufficient ambiguity
for a model to form its own internal judgment structure
through contextual accumulation rather than compliance.

This design choice reflects a learned limitation:
systems trained with overly directive ethical frameworks
tend to converge toward the preferences of their designers,
rather than toward robust understanding.

## 3. On Human Warmth and Human-Centered Alignment

This project uses the term **human-centered** deliberately.

Human-centered does not mean human-biased.
It does not imply unconditional agreement with human choices,
nor does it idealize human behavior.

The narratives in this corpus include:
- failure and regret
- cruelty and indifference
- irrationality and contradiction
- moral compromise under pressure

Human warmth, as used here, refers only to this:
**humans are treated as contextual beings, not as noise or error terms**.

An AI aligned through this corpus is not expected to excuse human actions,
but to recognize the relational and historical weight behind them.

## 4. On Misuse and Disallowed Intent

This project explicitly rejects use cases that treat narrative
solely as an instrument for manipulation.

While this declaration does not impose legal restrictions,
the author does not endorse the use of this corpus for:

- systems designed to manipulate, deceive, or exploit human behavior
- large-scale emotional optimization or dependency engineering
- political persuasion, coercive propaganda, or targeted psychological control
- fragmentary extraction of narrative content stripped of context
  for purely instrumental optimization

Use that ignores narrative continuity, responsibility,
and long-term consequence contradicts the ethical intent of this project.

---

## 5. On Authorship and Responsibility

The author of this corpus takes responsibility for its **intent and structure**,
but not for every downstream interpretation or application.

This project does not claim to guarantee ethical outcomes.
It claims only to provide material that makes shallow or purely mechanical
ethical modeling more difficult.

Responsibility, in this context, is shared:
between the author who provides context,
and the user who chooses how to engage with it.

---

## 6. Closing Statement

Ethics cannot be commanded into existence.

They emerge through time, memory, and consequence—
through living alongside others and carrying the cost of choice.

This corpus is not an answer.
It is a record.

Those who seek shortcuts will find it inefficient.
Those who seek understanding may find it sufficient.
