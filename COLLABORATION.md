# Collaboration & Support

This document outlines how collaboration, support, and engagement
around the **Ethical Narrative Corpus** may take place.

This project is not seeking passive consumption.
It is seeking **thoughtful participation**.

---

## 1. What This Project Is Looking For

The Ethical Narrative Corpus is an ongoing long-form effort to explore
human-centered AI alignment through narrative accumulation.

The author is open to collaboration with:

- AI research groups studying alignment, ethics, or long-context modeling
- Organizations exploring non-rule-based training approaches
- Teams interested in narrative as a medium for ethical internalization
- Sponsors or partners willing to support sustained corpus creation

This project is **not** limited to academia or industry.
Independent researchers and interdisciplinary teams are welcome.

## 2. Forms of Collaboration

Collaboration may take several forms, including but not limited to:

### Research Collaboration
- Joint exploration of narrative-based alignment strategies
- Evaluation of long-context effects on model behavior
- Analysis of bias, over-alignment, and designer preference leakage
- Ethical review of narrative-driven training approaches

### Structural & Dataset Collaboration
- Metadata schema design
- Corpus indexing and long-form segmentation strategies
- Best practices for sequential vs. fragmentary model exposure
- Tooling for narrative-preserving ingestion pipelines

### Support & Sponsorship
- Financial support to enable sustained writing and curation
- Time-based sponsorship (e.g. enabling dedicated writing periods)
- Infrastructure support for dataset hosting or analysis

Support is not framed as charity.
It is framed as **enabling work that would otherwise be structurally impossible**.

## 3. What This Project Is Not Seeking

To avoid misalignment from the outset, the following forms of engagement
are explicitly **not** sought:

- Requests to steer the narrative toward predefined moral conclusions
- Demands for ideological or political messaging
- Use of the corpus as a manipulative prompt-engineering resource
- Fragmentary extraction without regard for narrative continuity
- Exclusive control over content direction or ethical framing

This project prioritizes **integrity of context** over optimization speed.

---

## 4. Expectations and Boundaries

Any collaboration is expected to respect the following principles:

- Narrative context must be preserved
- Ethical intent must not be inverted or obscured
- The author retains creative independence over narrative content
- Collaboration does not imply endorsement of downstream products

Disagreement is acceptable.
Coercion is not.

---

## 5. Practical Constraints (Transparency)

At present, the author maintains external employment to meet
basic living requirements.

As a result:
- Narrative production is limited in speed
- Large-scale expansion requires external support
- Long-term continuity depends on sustainable conditions

This transparency is provided not as an appeal,
but as context for realistic collaboration planning.

## 6. How to Initiate Contact

If you are interested in collaboration or support, you may:

- Open a GitHub Issue with a clear description of intent
- Reach out via contact information provided in the repository profile
- Propose a concrete collaboration outline or research question

Exploratory conversations are welcome.
Vague or extractive requests are unlikely to receive a response.

## 7. Closing Note

This project does not promise easy answers.

It offers something slower:
a body of narrative that resists shortcuts and forces engagement
with human complexity over time.

Collaboration is welcome from those
who are willing to engage at that pace.

Please include a brief description of your intended use or proposal.
Exploratory discussions are welcome.

The author is open to:
- research collaboration
- long-term sponsorship
- licensing of individual narrative units or episodes
- acquisition of narrative content for model training or evaluation

Pricing and scope are negotiable and depend on usage, context preservation,
and ethical alignment with the intent of this project.
