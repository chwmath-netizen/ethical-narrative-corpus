# Corpus Usage Guide

This document explains how to read, interpret, and use the
**Ethical Narrative Corpus** as a long-form narrative dataset.

This corpus is not designed for casual browsing.
It is designed for **sequential exposure and contextual accumulation**.

---

## 1. Intended Reading Mode

The Ethical Narrative Corpus is meant to be read **in sequence**.

Each narrative unit assumes:
- prior context
- accumulated relationships
- remembered consequences
- unresolved tensions from earlier segments

Random sampling, shuffling, or isolated extraction
will significantly degrade the meaning and alignment signal
encoded in the corpus.

This is not a flaw.
It is a deliberate design choice.

---

## 2. Why Sequential Context Matters

Human ethical judgment does not emerge from isolated dilemmas.
It emerges from:

- memory of past actions
- responsibility carried over time
- repeated interaction with the same individuals
- long-term cost of short-term optimization

The narratives in this corpus are structured to reflect this reality.

Removing temporal continuity reduces the corpus to surface-level text.
Preserving continuity turns it into an **ethical environment**.

---

## 3. Corpus Structure

The corpus is organized by narrative lines rather than genres.

Each line maintains:
- consistent narrative voice
- stable internal logic
- cumulative character and social dynamics

Different lines may explore different settings or eras,
but they share a common approach to human behavior:
decisions are contextual, costly, and rarely clean.

Readers and users are encouraged to treat each line
as a self-contained ethical trajectory.

---

## 4. Language and Cultural Context

Most narrative texts in this corpus are written in **Korean**.

This choice reflects the author’s native language
and the cultural context in which the narratives were developed.

The corpus does not rely on language-specific sentiment cues.
Instead, it emphasizes:
- structural repetition
- role persistence
- social obligation
- delayed consequence

Modern language models are expected to handle multilingual input.
Cultural specificity is treated as an asset, not an obstacle.

---

## 5. Use in AI Training and Evaluation

When used for machine learning purposes, the corpus is best suited for:

- long-context training or evaluation
- alignment research focusing on internalized judgment
- analysis of over-alignment and designer preference leakage
- studies of narrative-driven ethical stabilization

Fragmentary ingestion may be useful for limited tasks,
but it does not represent the intended use of this corpus.

If fragments are used, users are encouraged to document:
- what context was removed
- what assumptions were introduced as a result

---

## 6. Known Limitations and Biases

This corpus reflects the perspective and limitations of a single author.

While multiple settings and viewpoints are explored,
the narratives inevitably carry:
- stylistic consistency
- recurring thematic concerns
- cultural assumptions tied to the author’s background

These limitations are not hidden.
They are part of the dataset and should be considered during analysis.

This corpus does not claim universality.
It claims **coherence**.

---

## 7. Ethical Handling of the Corpus

Users of this corpus are expected to:

- preserve narrative continuity when possible
- avoid decontextualized moral labeling
- resist optimizing away failure, regret, or inefficiency
- acknowledge the narrative nature of the data

Treating the corpus as disposable text
undermines the very signal it is meant to provide.

---

## 8. Closing Guidance

This corpus does not offer fast alignment.

It offers something slower:
exposure to human complexity that resists shortcuts.

Those seeking efficiency may find this corpus frustrating.
Those seeking understanding may find it sufficient.

Use it accordingly.
