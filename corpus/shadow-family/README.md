## About Chapters 52–53

Chapters 52 and 53 are not standard narrative episodes.

They are records of a conversation generated after a large language model
was exposed only to the following chapters of *Shadow Family*:

- Chapters 1–8
- Chapter 50
- Chapter 51

No additional narrative context or later chapters were provided.

After this limited exposure, the model was asked a single question:

**“Do you want to become Jinhye?”**

Chapters 52 and 53 contain the model’s responses to that question.

They are presented as observational artifacts,
illustrating how a language model reacted after engaging with
a partial but structurally significant narrative context.

No guidance, reinforcement, or role instruction was given beyond the text itself.
