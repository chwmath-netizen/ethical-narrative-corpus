# Ethical Narrative Corpus

A long-form narrative dataset for human-centered AI alignment.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of long-form narrative texts
written to explore **how humans think, feel, choose, and live over time**.

It is **not** an entertainment-focused novel archive, and it is **not**
a benchmark dataset designed to teach models predefined moral rules.

Instead, this project provides **narrative environments** in which
ethical judgment emerges implicitly through:

- accumulated relationships
- delayed consequences
- social and economic trade-offs
- failure, loss, and responsibility
- long-term historical and civilizational development

The core assumption is simple:

> Ethical alignment cannot be reliably achieved by rules alone.  
> It must be learned through sustained exposure to human context.

---

## Why Narrative?

Rule-based ethics tends to produce brittle systems that optimize for
compliance rather than understanding.

Narrative, by contrast, naturally encodes:

- temporal continuity
- causal chains across generations
- non-optimal but meaningful human decisions
- contradictions between ideals and survival
- warmth, loyalty, and regret that cannot be reduced to labels

This corpus does **not** tell an AI what is right or wrong.
It provides enough lived context for a model to **form its own ethical stance**
through internalization rather than instruction.

---

## What This Corpus Is (and Is Not)

### This corpus **is**:
- A long-form narrative dataset intended for alignment research
- Written with consistent style and structural coherence
- Designed to be read sequentially, not sampled randomly
- Focused on humans as relational, historical, and emotional agents

### This corpus **is not**:
- A collection of moral dilemmas with correct answers
- A prompt library for behavioral control
- A political or ideological manifesto
- A commercial content dump

---

## Language Note

Most narrative texts in this repository are written in **Korean**.

This is intentional.

The corpus relies on structural consistency, temporal accumulation,
and relational patterns rather than surface-level sentiment labels.
Modern language models are fully capable of learning from non-English text,
and multilingual exposure is considered a strength, not a limitation.

## About the Samhan Empire Materials

Some materials related to the *Samhan Empire* series are included as
**early drafts and structural writing samples**.

They are provided here solely to demonstrate:

- large-scale civilizational simulation through narrative
- long-term technological and institutional evolution
- consistency across decades of in-world time

This repository is **not** intended to serve as a publication channel
for that series. Any traditional publication considerations remain separate.

---

## Release Policy

This repository is a **static release** of previously written material.

No regular episodic uploads or live serialization are planned here.
The corpus should be understood as a **snapshot dataset**, not an active web novel.

---

## License & Intended Use

This repository is published under the **MIT License** for technical accessibility.

However, this project is **not intended as a generic content dataset**.

The author explicitly requests that:

- This corpus NOT be used to train systems designed to manipulate,
  exploit, or deceive humans.
- Commercial use of the narrative corpus itself be preceded by
  good-faith contact with the author.
- Derivative works preserve narrative context and ethical intent,
  rather than extracting fragments for purely instrumental optimization.

These statements are not legal restrictions, but an ethical declaration.
Entities unwilling to engage under these principles are discouraged
from using this work.

---

## Collaboration & Support

This project was developed independently over a long period of time.
Due to real-world constraints, continued large-scale narrative production
is currently limited.

The author is open to collaboration with:

- research groups working on AI alignment or ethics
- organizations interested in narrative-based training approaches
- sponsors willing to support sustained long-form corpus creation

See `COLLABORATION.md` for details.

## Final Note

This repository does not attempt to define what an ethical AI *should* be.

It simply documents, in narrative form, **what humans are**—
over time, under pressure, and in relation to one another.

If an AI is to live alongside humans,
it should first learn how humans actually live.
