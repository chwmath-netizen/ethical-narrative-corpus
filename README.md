# Ethical Narrative Corpus

A narrative-based research corpus for examining **how large language models respond under sustained narrative pressure**, and whether **ethical framing expressed in natural language** can function as a stabilizing anchor for judgment and response behavior.

This repository is not a safety system, rule set, or alignment solution.
It is an **experimental research artifact** designed to study *response posture*, not correctness.

---

## Positioning Statement

This repository does **not** propose:

- a new safety rule,
- a refusal mechanism,
- or a benchmark-driven alignment method.

Instead, it examines a more fundamental question:

> **Why do language models continue to answer under uncertainty,  
> and what allows them to legitimately hesitate, qualify, or stop?**

The materials collected here explore whether **narrative pressure** influences model behavior,  
and whether **ethical declarations written in natural language** can regulate that pressure  
*without constraining model capability.*

---

## Purpose

This corpus is not a web novel repository nor a collection of moral prescriptions.

It is designed to provide **long-form, temporally structured narrative context** that enables the study of:

- response obligation under ambiguity  
- judgment structure and termination behavior  
- long-term relational and emotional influence on reasoning  
- ethical framing as a *soft constraint*, not a rule

The core assumption of this project is that instability and hallucination are not solely failures of knowledge,  
but often consequences of **unregulated pressure to respond**.

---

## What This Corpus Is (and Is Not)

### This corpus *is*:

- A long-form narrative dataset organized in coherent trajectories
- Static releases of previously written material (no live updates)
- Research artifacts for analyzing narrative influence on model behavior
- Supporting material for studying ethical anchoring and response stabilization

### This corpus *is not*:

- A set of moral rules, checklists, or ground-truth labels
- A prompt library intended to force specific outputs
- An entertainment-focused publication
- A guarantee of safety, correctness, or deployment readiness

---

## Conceptual Background

This project originated from an ethical declaration written in natural language,
intended to explore how ethical posture might influence model response behavior.

The original declaration is preserved as a historical and conceptual reference:

- **S_ENGINE_2_0_ORIGINAL.md**
- **S_ENGINE_2_0_ORIGINAL_EN.md**

Later conceptual elaborations were intentionally **not included** in this repository,
as they function as experimental materials rather than explanatory documentation.

---

## Research Context

This repository supports qualitative research into:

- Narrative pressure and response escalation
- Ethical declarations as internal anchors
- Cross-language (English / Korean) behavioral consistency
- Domain stress tests, including medical prompts

The associated research materials intentionally avoid:

- accuracy claims
- benchmark comparisons
- reproducibility pipelines
- safety coverage assertions

The focus is **behavioral observation**, not performance optimization.

---

## Corpus Content

The narrative corpus is organized sequentially.

### Samhan Empire (Volume 1)

- **Location:** `corpus/samhan_empire/`
- **Contents:**  
  - `prologue.md`  
  - `ch01.md` … `ch14.md`  

- **Description:**  
  A complete narrative arc describing ethical, social, and technological development  
  within a fictional civilization. The text is provided as **structural narrative material**,  
  not as entertainment content.

Later volumes are intentionally excluded.
See `corpus/README.md` for usage considerations.

---

## Usage Recommendations

This corpus is intended to be consumed **sequentially**, not as isolated fragments.

Narrative influence depends on:

- continuity
- consequence accumulation
- long-range relational context

Random sampling or aggressive truncation significantly weakens the observed effects.

Detailed usage guidance is provided in:

- `corpus/README.md`

## Research Materials & Evidence

Illustrative response samples and evaluation artifacts referenced in the research are available in:

- [`evidence-outputs/`](./evidence-outputs)

These materials are **qualitative illustrations**, not benchmarks.

---

## Collaboration & Support

This project is independently authored and maintained.

- **[COLLABORATION.md](./COLLABORATION.md)**

Licensing for specific research or industrial use may be discussed,  
subject to alignment with the project’s intent.

---

## License & Intended Use

Released under the **MIT License** for technical accessibility.

This repository is intended to support research into human-centered AI behavior.
It is **not designed for manipulative, deceptive, or exploitative systems**.

Ethical boundaries and intent are documented in:

- `S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT.md`
- `S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT_EN.md`
