# Ethical Narrative Corpus

A long-form narrative dataset for human-centered AI alignment and ethical context grounding.

This repository collects narrative texts and alignment concepts designed to support research into *how narrative context influences reasoning, ethical judgment, and long-term relational understanding in advanced AI systems.*

---

## Purpose

This corpus is not a web novel repository nor a set of moral rules.

It is designed to provide large-scale, temporally structured narrative contexts that help researchers and models explore *human decision complexity*, long-term consequences, and relational dynamics **without prescribing fixed answers**.

This project assumes that ethical alignment emerges less from strict rules and more from **sustained exposure to contextual human behavior**.

---

## What This Corpus Is (and Is Not)

### This corpus *is*:
- Long-form narrative text organized in coherent trajectories
- Static releases of previously written material
- Artifacts for alignment research, including structural and contextual evaluation
- A demonstration of narrative influence on long-term reasoning

### This corpus *is not*:
- A collection of moral checklists or “ground truth” labels
- A prompt library intended to *force* specific model outputs
- Entertainment-centric publication material (novel consumption reading)

For detailed ethical intent and framework, see the conceptual section below.

## Conceptual Framework

This project’s guiding philosophy and alignment intentions
are described in these documents:

- **[S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT.md](./S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT.md)** — Core conceptual description
- **[S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT_EN.md](./S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT_EN.md)** — English conceptual version

These documents outline how narrative context and cognitive posture
interact to reduce hallucination and promote *contextualized judgment*.

---

## Corpus Content

The narrative corpus itself is organized in lines. The first major
narrative line is:

### Samhan Empire (Volume 1)
- **Location:** `corpus/samhan_empire/`
- **Contents:**  
  - `prologue.md`  
  - `ch01.md` … `ch14.md`  
- **Description:**  
  A complete narrative arc covering the initial ethical, social, and
  technological development of a fictional civilization. Intended as
  structural narrative material, not entertainment content.

**Note:** Later volumes are *not* included in this corpus.
See `corpus/README.md` for usage guidance.

---

## Usage Recommendations

This corpus is intended to be consumed *sequentially* rather than
as isolated fragments.

Narrative context carries relational continuity, consequence accumulation,
and structural influence over long spans of text. Random sampling
or incoherent truncation reduces the alignment signal.

For detailed guidance on using this corpus in research or training
scenarios, see:
- `corpus/README.md`

## Collaboration & Support

This project is independently authored and maintained.

For collaboration, support, or research partnership inquiries,
see **[COLLABORATION.md](./COLLABORATION.md)**.

This corpus may also be licensed for specific uses; terms
are negotiable and depend on alignment with the project’s intent.

## License & Intended Use

Published under the **MIT License** for technical accessibility.

For ethical intent, boundaries, and handling rationale, see:
- `S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT.md`
- `S_ENGINE_2_0_CONCEPT_EN.md`

This repository is intended to promote positive understanding of
contextual human behavior, and is not designed for use in manipulative,
deceptive, or exploitative systems.
